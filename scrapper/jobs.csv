Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day). This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time. About The Role:Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day.

Take a look at what our past intern cohort worked on with our Blog post and TikTok post.What You'll Achieve:Write clean, secure, tested, and documented code.Design & enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.Qualifications:Pursuing a bachelor's, master's, or PhD degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Targeting a 2025 full-time start date.Previous internship experience.Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.You are able to problem-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.This internship will take place from May - September (based on your summer schedule) and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.Skills You’ll Need To Bring:Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context.

You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor.
